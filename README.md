<h1 align="center">‚òÄÔ∏è<br>The Office Guest Stars</h1> 

- In my recent project, titled ‚ÄúExploratory Data Analysis with Python‚Äù, I leveraged the power of Python to perform data analysis on a real-world dataset. I utilized various Python libraries such as pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib for data visualization.

- The primary goal of my project was to uncover insights from the data through exploratory data analysis. This involved a series of steps:

- <b>Data Collection:</b> I gathered data relevant to the problem I was trying to solve.

- <b>Data Cleaning:</b> I preprocessed and cleaned the data, handling missing values and outliers.

- <b>Data Exploration:</b> I explored the data, using descriptive statistics and data visualization to find patterns, trends, and relationships in the data.

- <b> Drawing Conclusions:</b> Based on my exploration, I drew meaningful conclusions about the data.

- One of the key findings of my project was understanding if Netflix‚Äôs movies are getting shorter over time. Additionally, I analyzed which guest stars appear in the most popular episode of ‚ÄúThe Office‚Äù.

- This project not only showcased my technical skills in Python and data analysis but also demonstrated my ability to derive meaningful insights from data. It‚Äôs a testament to my problem-solving abilities and my proficiency in using Python for Data Science.
